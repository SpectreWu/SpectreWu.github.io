<b>Introduction</b><br>

<c>"VALORANT" is a team-based shooting game and a first-person shooter game. The classic gameplay adopts a five-on-five blasting mode, and there are other original modes for players to choose from.
There are all kinds of weapons in the game. With the money called "Creds" obtained from killing enemy troops, installing bombs, demolition bombs, and winning the round, you can buy the required guns and protection through the economic system. First. There are seven types of weapons in the game, namely pistols, submachine guns, shotguns, heavy weapons, rifles, sniper rifles and melee weapons. Like other first-person shooters, each weapon has recoil and must be controlled by the player for accurate shooting.
In terms of game rules, similar to the "Blast Mode" in other shooting games, the attacker will carry a bomb called "Spike", which must be placed within the round time. If the attacker successfully detonates the bomb or annihilates all the members of the defending team, it will be regarded as the victory of the round and one point; If bombs are placed within the round time, the defending team wins the round; after 12 rounds of firefights, there will be an exchange of offense and defense, and the first team to win thirteen rounds is the winner of the match.
The game features that players can use game characters with different skills called "Agents") to participate in battles and divide the corresponding work in the team to help the team win. As a first-person shooting game, "Special War Hero" pays special attention to the accuracy of the player's shooting. In the design of weapon damage, hitting the head can cause a lot of damage to other parts.</c>
